            <p className="ms-4">To optimise the information we provide, you will also find links on our website that refer to third-party websites. Where this is not recognisable, we point out that this is an external link.  SHRL does not influence the measures taken thereon to protect your data. SHRL asks that you refer to the respective privacy policies there. Consequently, the warranties of this privacy policy naturally do not apply to these third-party sites.</p>
            <p className="ms-4">From time to time, SHRL may offer a feature that allows you to send an electronic postcard or otherwise share a message with a friend, relative or any other person known to you, whether via the Internet, a stand-alone kiosk or a mobile device. If you choose to use this feature, we may ask you for the recipient’s name, email address, and text of any message you choose to include. By using this feature, you represent that you are entitled to use it. Please provide us with the recipient’s name and email address.</p>
            <p className="ms-4">Further, we may receive your personal information from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, data firms, and social media platforms, from people with whom you are friends or otherwise connected on social media platforms, as well as from other third parties. For example, suppose you elect to connect your social media account to your website account. In that case, certain personal information from your social media account will be shared with us, including personal information that is part of your public profile or your friends' public profiles.</p>
            <h2 className="fw-light ms-3">Sensitive Personal Data:</h2>
            <p className="ms-4">The term “sensitive personal data” refers to information related to your sex life, sexual orientation, biometric data, genetic data, transgender status, intersex status, caste or tribe, religious or political belief or affiliation, or any other category of data specified by applicable statutes. We do not generally collect such sensitive personal data, and you are not supposed to disclose it unless you volunteer.</p>

                Storage And Security Of Your Personal Information
            </h2>
            <p className="ms-4"> SH endeavours to take all reasonable steps to secure any information we hold about you and to keep this information accurate and up to date. SH uses a sophisticated computer data network, and access to all computer and system devices is password-controlled. Employees can only access data if they are authorised, and we maintain an audit log that records each time a file is accessed. We also require our employees and data processors to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by SH.</p>
            <p className="ms-4">
            Data is secured in a secure data centre environment, with daily backups of all data taken and a copy of all data kept offsite. Our data network is private and not accessible over the Internet. We use sophisticated detection and intrusion technologies to ensure no network security breaches.

            <p className="ms-4">
            Please note also that as a global business, SH may use overseas facilities to process or back up its information. As a result, we may store your personal information in our overseas facilities for storage. However, we will only store information overseas as authorised by the Privacy Act and in keeping with our other commitments to safeguard your privacy.
